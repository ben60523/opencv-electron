# Build opencv4nodejs
```
npm install https://github.com/ben60523/npm-opencv-build.git
npm install https://github.com/ben60523/opencv4nodejs.git
# Build .node file
node node_modules\opencv4nodejs\install\install.js
# Rebuild with electron-rebuild
node node_modules\opencv4nodejs\install\install.js e
```
# plain-js
This example shows how to use opencv4nodejs with electron and plain HTML + Javascript without any bundler.

## Running this example:

### Set up opencv4nodejs, electron and rebuild the module for electron:
``` bash
npm install
```

### Run:
``` bash
npm start
```

# webpack-reactjs
This example shows how to use opencv4nodejs with webpack and react, requires node-loader to load the native addon.
``` bash
npm i node-loader
```

## On windows
If you are using the autobuild on windows, you have to append the path to the binaries
to the path env of main process manually as follows (in main.js):
```
if (process.platform === 'win32' && !process.env.OPENCV4NODEJS_DISABLE_AUTOBUILD) {
  process.env.path += ';' + require('../renderer/node_modules/opencv-build').opencvBinDir
}
```

## Running this example:

In the root directory:
``` bash
npm install
npm start
```

In another terminal cd into ./renderer and run the dev server:
``` bash
npm install
npm start
```

# Known issues

If you are receiving the following error on windows during electron-rebuild:
``` bash
AttributeError: 'MSVSProject' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
```

Delete fsevents from your node_modules folder and rerun:
```
npm run electron-rebuild
```
